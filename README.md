# virtualvultures
Virtual Vultures is a virtual jet team that meets through Digital Combat Simulator to practice formation flying regularly. 

The site goes in to detail about why the team was formed, a video background, and a gallery of screenshots from the game. The team also flies in virtual air shows on Twitch, so there is information regarding that along with a contact form if any organizers for those shows would like to reach out.

The VVJT color scheme is red and black and we decided that the site would reflect that as well. Use of Parallax scrolling was implemented as well as Fullscreen Lightbox library to display photos in the gallery.
