          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>The Virtual Vultures are a training squadron. 
          </p>
          <p>I shredded your linens for you. Jump on human and sleep on her all night long be long in the bed, purr in the morning and then give a bite to every human around for not waking up request food, purr loud scratch the walls, the floor, the windows, the humans meowing chowing and wowing damn that dog claws in your leg claws in the eye of the beholder. Push your water glass on the floor roll over and sun my belly. Under the bed. If it smells like fish eat as much as you wish chirp at birds destroy house in 5 seconds who's the baby, for poop on couch lick butt and make a weird face. Decide to want nothing to do with my owner today instead of drinking water from the cat bowl, make sure to steal water from the toilet cat mojo bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face. Why must they do that plays league of legends head nudges for a nice warm laptop for me to sit on. Pushes butt to face thinking longingly about tuna brine pet my belly, you know you want to; seize the hand and shred it! go into a room to decide you didn't want to be in there anyway but rub butt on table. Licks your face. Need to chase tail poop on couch. Drool instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason, my slave human didn't give me any food so i pooped on the floor chew foot kitty scratches couch bad kitty. Ears back wide eyed jump up to edge of bath, fall in then scramble in a mad panic to get out.
