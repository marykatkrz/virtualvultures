            <p>   The Virtual Vultures began in 2016 as a group of friends learning formation flying together. We met on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aerobaticsonline/" target="_blank">Aerobatics Online</a> Multiplayer server in Digital Combat Simulator World. We began flying formation and meeting more people along the way. Before long we had enough people to form a team. We decided to begin work on a routine and adopted the name Virtual Vultures. The name was adopted from the real world Vulture formation team who flew Vans RV6's and Rutan Long-EZ's. A member of our team flew a Long-EZ with the Vultures and his knowledge and experience was instrumental in our learning of formation techniques. </p>

            <p> During this time we learned about <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/virtualairshows" target="_blank">Virtual Airshows</a> and the Virtual Aerobatics community. This community is a large and welcoming group of like minded aviation enthusiasts who share our passion for aviation and our love for formation flying. There are hundreds of teams and solo performers who work extremely hard to create exciting and realistic shows. They perform these shows live in front of hundreds of people through the events organized by the people at Virtual Airshows.

            <p> Our biggest inspiration was the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VirtualBlackDiamondJetTeam/" target="_blank">Virtual Black Diamond Jet Team.</a> They are veterans of Virtual Airshows and are a great example of the precision and dedication that we aspire to achieve. We were lucky enough to become friends with the team members of the VBDJT and fly with them regularly, learning a great deal from them in the process.

            <p>We were accepted into our first public show in 2017 which was the Virtual United Air Festival.
                Our training began six months prior and consisted of practicing 3 times per week for 2-4 hours.
            During this time we added an opposing solo position to take the show from a 4 ship to a 5 ship routine.

            <h4><a href="https://www.facebook.com/virtualairshows/" target="_blank">Virtual Festival of Aerobatic Teams</a> - December 9th, 2017</h4>
            <p>  This show was a big challenge. It was flown at a      differant location than where we learned our routine
              and this was a new obstacle for us. We had to learn how to fit our maneuvers and routine into the very different landscape in only one month. On top of that we had to use a new, open beta version of the game which had a lot of issues at the time. These problems cost us a lot of time and practice and made preparing for this show, 
              the hardest challenge we ever faced as a team.

            <p>For burning lake we took on more big challenges, first of all being the location. This show is held over a lake, tucked into the mountains and surrounded by large hills on three sides. This meant we had to re-design all of our repositioning turns and manuevers to account for the terrain. On top of that challenge, this was also the first show we did with a differant lead pilot and as a six aircraft formation. Our right wing pilot "Arrow" flew as lead for this show and "Dano" flew as the opposing solo number six.
