             The Virtual Thunderbirds, LLC is a fan based group, widely recognized on the net as the virtual equivalent of the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds. They perform formation flying and precision aerobatics with the use of flight simulators. Their mission is to reenact the aerial demonstration of the USAF Thunderbirds, past and present. This includes adhering to the real world radio calls, maneuver parameters and procedures, professionalism, and unbelievable attention to detail, a trademark the USAF Thunderbirds have been known for throughout its history since 1953. Many of the Virtual Thunderbird pilots are also real world aviators with several thousand hours of flying experience, however, this is not a requirement to become a Virtual Thunderbird. They encourage aviation enthusiasts with passion for flying to tryout for the team.
